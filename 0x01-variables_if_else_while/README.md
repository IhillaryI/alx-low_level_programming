This directory contains project based learning files which builds on the concepts previously learned on low level programming using C.
Below is a list of files and brief descriptions with it.

---

- **0-positive_or_negative.c**: This C program when run indicates whether `n` is a positive or negative number
- **1-last_digit.c**: This C program indicates whether `n` is greater than 0 and less than 6, or n is greater than 5, or n is equal to 0
- **2-print_alphabet.c**: This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	- Used only `putchar` function
	- Used `putchar` function only twice in code
- **3-print_alphabets.c**: This C program prints the alpabets: lowercase and uppercase, and a new line.
	- Used only `putchar` function
