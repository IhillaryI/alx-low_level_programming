This directory contains project based learning files which builds on concepts previously learned on low leveling programming using C. Below is a list of files and a brief description of the files.

---

- **0-putchar.c**: Prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line
- **1-print_alphabet**: Prints lower case alphabets from a to z
- **2-print_alphabet_x10.c**: Prints lower case alphabets from a to z, 10 times.
- **3-islower.c**: checks if a give character is lowercase or not.
- **4-isalpha.c**: checks if a given character is alphabetic, regardless of case
- **5-sign.c**: checks and prints the sign of a given number.
- **6-abs.c**: returns the absolute value of a given interger.
- **7-print_last_digit.c**: returns and prints the last digit of a given number
- **8-24_hours.c**: prints minutes and hours in 24 hours.
- **9-times_table.c**: prints multiplication table from 0 to 9
- **10-add.c**: returns the result of adding two integers
- **11-print_to_98.c**: prints digits from n to 98.
- **100-times_table.c**: prints times table for a given integer length.
- **101-natural.c**: prints the total sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1024
- **102-fibonacci.c**: print first 50 fibonacci numbers, starting from 1 and 2.
- **103-fibonacci.c**: By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
